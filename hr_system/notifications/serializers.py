"""
Serializer definitions for the notifications API.

Serializers convert ``Notification`` model instances into JSON for
REST API responses.  Only a limited subset of fields are exposed to
clients to prevent modification of systemâ€‘generated values.  The
``recipient`` field is read only and presented as a string
representation of the user.
