"""
Celery application configuration for the hr_system project.

This module sets up the Celery application and instructs it to read
configuration from the Django settings module using the ``CELERY_`` prefix.
It also autoâ€‘discovers task modules across all installed Django apps.

Having a separate ``celery.py`` file allows Celery to be initialised
without importing the entire Django stack, which helps avoid side
effects during process startup.  See Django/Celery documentation for
additional details.
