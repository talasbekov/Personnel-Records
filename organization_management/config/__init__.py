"""
Initialisation for the organization_management Django project.

This module conditionally imports the Celery application so that tasks
are autoâ€‘discovered when Celery workers are running.  The import is
wrapped in a ``try`` block to avoid raising a ``ModuleNotFoundError``
in environments where Celery is not installed (e.g. during local
development or documentation builds).
